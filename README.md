# Console RPG

Simple console rpg game base.

* **Game** is the main loop and UI class.
* **World** holds entities (enemies, rocks, trees), world map (right now only dots for grass) and player.
* **Actions** hold whatever happends when an entity wanna do something, move, attack and so on.
* **Entites** Used to hold different entities, but it was abstracted to just one class to rule them all (good or bad, who knows). Sci-fi or fantasy, maybe you want a tree that can move or a rock that can teleport and talk?
